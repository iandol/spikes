% Display an animated grating using the new Screen('DrawTexture') command.
% In the OS X Psychtoolbox Screen('DrawTexture') replaces
% Screen('CopyWindow'). The demo will stop after roughly 20 seconds have
% passed or after the user hits a key.
%
% This demo illustrates how to draw an animated grating online by use of
% only one grating texture. We create one texture with a static sine
% grating. In each successive frame we only draw a rectangular subregion of
% the sine-texture onto the screen, basically showing the texture through
% an aperture. The subregion - and therefore our "aperture" is shifted each
% frame, so we create the impression of a moving grating.
%
% The demo also shows how to use alpha-blending for masking the grating
% with a gaussian transparency mask (a texture with transparency layer).
%
% And finally, we demonstrate rotated drawing, as well as how to emulate
% the old OS-9 'WaitBlanking' command with the new 'Flip' command.
%
% Parameters:
%
% angle = Angle of the grating with respect to the vertical direction.
% cyclespersecond = Speed of grating in cycles per second.
% f = Frequency of grating in cycles per pixel.
% drawmask = If set to 1, then a gaussian aperture is drawn over the grating
%
% CopyWindow vs. DrawTexture:
%
% In the OS 9 Psychtoolbox, Screen ('CopyWindow") was used for all
% time-critical display of images, in particular for display of the movie
% frames in animated stimuli. In contrast, Screen('DrawTexture') should not
% be used for display of all graphic elements, but only for display of
% MATLAB matrices. For all other graphical elements, such as lines, rectangles,
% and ovals we recommend that these be drawn directly to the display
% window during the animation rather than rendered to offscreen windows
% prior to the animation.
