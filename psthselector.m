function fig = psthselector()
% This is the machine-generated representation of a Handle Graphics object
% and its children.  Note that handle values may change when these objects
% are re-created. This may cause problems with any callbacks written to
% depend on the value of the handle at the time the object was saved.
% This problem is solved by saving the output as a FIG-file.
%
% To reopen this object, just type the name of the M-file at the MATLAB
% prompt. The M-file and its associated MAT-file must be on your path.
% 
% NOTE: certain newer features in MATLAB may not have been saved in this
% M-file due to limitations of this format, which has been superseded by
% FIG-files.  Figures which have been annotated using the plot editor tools
% are incompatible with the M-file/MAT-file format, and should be saved as
% FIG-files.
