%   Y = DIRECTCOUNTTOTAL(X,OPTS) counts the words in cell array X and
%   stores the results in a HIST1D data structure Y. 
%
%   There are currently no user-specified options or parameters for
%   this function. Therefore OPTS is ignored.
%
%   Y = DIRECTCOUNTTOTAL(X) has exactly the same behavior as above.
%
%   [Y,OPTS_USED] = DIRECTCOUNTTOTAL(X,OPTS) copies OPTS into OPTS_USED.
