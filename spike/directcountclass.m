%DIRECTCOUNTCLASS Count spike train words in each class.
%   Y = DIRECTCOUNTCLASS(X,OPTS) counts the words in cell array X
%   in which the words are segragated by class. The results are
%   stored in a HIST1DVEC data structure Y. 
%
%   There are currently no user-specified options or parameters for
%   this function. Therefore OPTS is ignored.
%
%   Y = DIRECTCOUNTCLASS(X) has exactly the same behavior as above.
%
%   [Y,OPTS_USED] = DIRECTCOUNTCLASS(X,OPTS) copies OPTS into OPTS_USED.
