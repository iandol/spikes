   Y = CTWMCMC(X_STREAM,X_REPLICA,OPTS) uses the context-tree weighted
   (CTW) method paired with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian
   techniques to estimate the amount of information conveyed by the spike
   train in X_STREAM (the &quot;signal&quot; entropy) when accounting for the
   variance of the spike responses in X_REPLICA (the &quot;noise&quot; entropy). The
   results are stored in the structure Y.

   The members of Y are:
      Y.stream_binned: Binned versions of the spike trains in X_STREAM.
         See DIRECTBIN for details.
      Y.replica_binned: Binned versions of the spike trains in X_REPLICA.
         See DIRECTBIN for details.
      Y.stream_tree: A CTW tree graph of the data in X_STREAM. See
         CTWMCMCTREE for details.
      Y.replica_tree: The CTW tree graphs of the data in X_REPLICA. See
         CTWMCMCTREE for details.
      Y.estimates: A structure with &quot;signal&quot; and &quot;noise&quot; entropy estimates
         derived from X_STREAM and X_REPLICA, respectively, as well as
         estimates of information and its confidence intervals. See
         CTWMCMCSAMPLE and CTWMCMCINFO for details.

   The options and parameters for this function are:
      OPTS.start_time: The start time of the analysis window. The
         default is the maximum of all of the start times in X. It is
         typically best not to specify this value, as the start times for
         X_STREAM and X_REPLICA may be different.
      OPTS.end_time: The end time of the analysis window. The
         default is the minimum of all of the end times in X. It is
         typically best not to specify this value, as the end times for
         X_STREAM and X_REPLICA may be different.
      OPTS.counting_bin_size: The size of the counting bins in
         seconds. The default is OPTS.end_time-OPTS.start_time.
      OPTS.letter_cap: Places a cap on the maximum number of spikes
         to be counted in a bin. The default value is Inf.
      OPTS.beta: Krischevsky-Trofimov ballast parameter used in the
         calculation of local codelength, Le, which also serves as the
         Dirichlet prior parameter in subsequent Markov chain Monte Carlo
         (MCMC) tree sampling. Its value should be greater than 0. The
         default is 1/A, where A is the largest value in the input data X
         plus one.
      OPTS.gamma: The weighting between tree node and its children, used
         when calculating the weighted codelength, Lw. Its value should
         lie between 0 and 1, non-inclusive. The default is 0.5.
      OPTS.max_tree_depth: The maximum tree depth (may be used to conserve
         memory). Its value must be greater than 0. The default is 1000.
      OPTS.h_zero: Flag to indicate use of the H_zero estimator for
         deterministic nodes, that is such nodes will not be weighted when
         true. The default is 1 (true).
      OPTS.tree_format: The format for the output tree graph(s), if
         requested. Its value may be the string 'none', 'cell', or
         'struct', which is a trade-off between memory consumption and
         clarity. Data output in cell format consume less memory, but are
         not easy to decipher, whereas data output in struct format are
         memory-intensive, but readily human-readable. The default is
         'none', which does not export any tree graphs.
      OPTS.memory_expansion: The ratio by which tree memory is expanded
         when reallocation become necessary during tree building. Its
         value must be greater than or equal to 1. The default is 1.61.
      OPTS.nmc: The number of MCMC samples to make. Its value must be
         greater than 0, and should be at least 100. The default is 199.
      OPTS.entropy_estimation_method: A cell array of entropy estimation
         methods. Please see the Spike Train Analysis Toolkit
         documentation for more information, and corresponding entropy
         options. The default is {'plugin'}.
      OPTS.variance_estimation_method: A cell array of variance
         estimation methods. Please see the Spike Train Analysis Toolkit
         documentation for more information, and corresponding variance
         options (listed with entropy options). The default is not to
         perform any variance estimation.
      OPTS.mcmc_iterations: The absolute number of iterations to run the
         Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (for each OPTS.nmc sample).
         If OPTS.mcmc_min_acceptances probability vectors have been
         accepted, this is also the minimum number of iterations. The
         default is 100.
      OPTS.mcmc_max_iterations: The maximum number of Markov chain Monte
         Carlo iterations. The simulation runs OPTS.mcmc_iterations sized
         batches of iterations until OPTS.mcmc_min_acceptances probability
         vectors are accepted, or this number is reached. The default is
         10000.
      OPTS.mcmc_min_acceptances: The minimum number of Markov chain Monte
         Carlo acceptances, that is the number of acceptable probability
         vectors. The default is 20.

   Y = CTWMCMC(X_STREAM,X_REPLICA) uses default options and parameters.

   [Y,OPTS_USED] = CTWMCMC(X_STREAM,X_REPLICA) or [Y,OPTS_USED] =
   CTWMCMC(X_STREAM,X_REPLICA,OPTS) additionally return the options used.
