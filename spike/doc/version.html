<tr><th>Number</th><th>Date</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>Version 0.1</td><td>June 23, 2005</td><td>Initial release</td></tr>

<tr><td>Version 0.2</td><td>March 3, 2006</td><td>Added multineuron capabilities to direct and metric space methods</td></tr>

<tr><td>Version 0.2.1</td><td>March 27, 2006</td><td>Inclusion of functions for calculation of formal information rate with the direct method</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td>Version 0.9</td>
<td>June 22, 2006</td>
<td>
<p>Improvements and new features:<ul>
<li>Eliminated <tt>directhash</tt> function (now internal to <tt>directcount</tt> functions)
<li>Added Ma entropy estimate
<li>Added bootstrap variance estimate
<li>Made shuffling and jackknifing scripts more efficient
<li>Added <tt>staversion</tt> function
<li>Added D<sup>interval</sup>[q] in metric space method
</ul></p>
<p>There are few incompatibilities with earlier releases:
<ul><li>The option <tt>variance_estimate_method</tt> is now called <tt>variance_estimation_method</tt>.
<li>The &quot;single q&quot; and &quot;all q&quot; metric space method functions have been combined. The single q/all q choice is now specified with the option <tt>parallel</tt>.
<li>Function <tt>metric</tt>'s output structure has been modifed. The member <tt>m_list</tt> is now called <tt>categories</tt>.
</ul>
</p>

<tr valign="top"><td>Version 0.9.1</td>
<td>September 15, 2006</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Now requires the GNU Scientific Library
<li>Added Best Upper Bounds method to entropy estimation methods
<li>Fixed bug that was suppressing diagnostic messages on Windows and Mac
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top"><td>Version 1.0 Beta</td>
<td>November 28, 2006</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Explicit bias correction methods eliminated, now listed as separate entropy estimation methods
<li>Introduced general and method-specific variance estimation methods
<li>In earlier versions, the jackknife and bootstrap variance estimates in all estimate structures were obtained using the plug-in method instead of the method named in the estimate structure. This has been fixed.
<li>Added Chao-Shen entropy estimation method
<li>Added Wolpert-Wolf entropy estimation method
<li>Code reorganized to facilitate external contributions
<li>Contribution instructions added
</ul>
