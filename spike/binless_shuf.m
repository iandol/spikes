function [out,shuf,opts_used]=binless_shuf(X,opts,S)
%BINLESS_SHUF Binless method analysis with shuffled inputs.
%   [Y,SHUF] = BINLESS_SHUF(X,OPTS,S) performs a binless method
%   analysis on input data structure X. In addition to the typical
%   analysis, this function also analyzes S versions of X with the
%   categories randomly shuffled. Y is an output structure with the
%   results of the typical analysis and SHUF is an Sx1 array of output
%   structures with the results for each category permutation. For
%   information on the output structure, see BINLESS.
%
%   For information on options and parameters see BINLESS.
%
%   [Y,SHUF] = BINLESS_SHUF(X,[],S) uses the default options and parameters.
%
%   [Y,SHUF,OPTS_USED] = BINLESS_SHUF(X,[],S) or [Y,SHUF,OPTS_USED] =
%   BINLESS_SHUF(X,OPTS,S) additionally return the options used. 
%
