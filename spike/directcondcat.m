%DIRECTCONDCAT Condition data on category.
%   Y = DIRECTCONDCAT(X,OPTS) reorganizes a 2-D cell array (such as is
%   given by the output of DIRECTBIN) into a 1-D cell column vector
%   where each element corresponds to a category.
%
%   There are currently no user-specified options or parameters for
%   this function. Therefore OPTS is ignored.
%
%   Y = DIRECTCONDCAT(X) has exactly the same behavior as above.
%
%   [Y,OPTS_USED] = DIRECTCONDCAT(X,OPTS) copies OPTS into OPTS_USED.

%   DIRECTCOUNTCLASS, DIRECTCOUNTCLASS, DIRECTCOUNTCOND.
