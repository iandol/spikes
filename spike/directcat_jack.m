function [out,jk,opts_used]=directcat_jack(X,opts)
%DIRECTCAT_JACK Direct method analysis to determine category-specific information with leave-one-out jackknife.
%   [Y,JK] = DIRECTCAT_JACK(X,OPTS) performs a direct method
%   analysis on input data structure X. In addition to the typical
%   analysis, this function also does a leave-one-out jackknife. Y
%   is an output structure with the results of the typical analysis
%   and JK is an array of output structures with the results for each
%   jackknife trial. There are as many elements in JK as there are
%   spike trains in X. For information on the output structure, see
%   DIRECTCAT. 
%
%   For information on options and parameters see DIRECT.
%
%   [Y,JK] = DIRECTCAT_JACK(X) uses the default options and parameters.
%
%   [Y,JK,OPTS_USED] = DIRECTCAT_JACK(X) or [Y,JK,OPTS_USED] =
%   DIRECT_JACK(X,OPTS) additionally return the options used. 
%
